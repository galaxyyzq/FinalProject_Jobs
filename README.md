# JobJungle
Our project is the occupation information platform that can inspire people with ideas about different jobs in the world and visualize the relationship between jobs and related skills. Based on the data generated by search function and ‘like’ function, the web can also create the network analysis and visualization about user’s interests.

## What we have done
- The initial app and basic web structure: react+semantic UI.
- Loading job data from API.
- Interactive job data Visualization (On the folder "Visualization", but not merge in main app yet)
- Page switch
- Search function
- View layout

## Plan
- Complete functionalities:
  - Add view history page
  - Load google trend data in job and skill page
  - Related photos in job and skill page
  - Merge network visualization in job and skill page
- Add more interaction:
  - Sorting skill item by draging
  - Select and filter skill item from the whole skill pool
  - ...
- UI beautify

## File Structure 
(short description/purpose of each file)
- Public: pure html and other data
- src: reactjs and css
  - components: the pure code for presentation without storing data
  - containers:
    - App.js: the beginning file and store data
    - ….js: map to each page view
