# JobJungle
Our project is the occupation information platform that can inspire people with ideas about different jobs in the world and visualize the relationship between jobs and related skills. Based on the data generated by search function and ‘like’ function, the web can also create the network analysis and visualization about user’s interests.

## What we have done

## Plan

  - Merge network visualization in job and skill page
- Add more interaction:

  - Select and filter skill item from the whole skill pool
  - ...
